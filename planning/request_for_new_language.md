**Subject**: Request to Add New Language “Mandar” (ISO 639-3: mdr) to Tatoeba

**Body**:

Hello Tatoeba Language Team,

I am writing to request the addition of a new language-Mandar-to Tatoeba. Below are the details for my request:

**Language Name**: Mandar \
**ISO 639-3 Code**: mdr \
**Sentence List**: I have created a public list containing over 10 sentences in Mandar. You can view it here; <https://tatoeba.org/en/sentences_lists/show/173571> \
**Icon**: I have attached a suggested icon for Mandar; <https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Flag_of_West_Sulawesi.svg>

Additional Information: Mandar is my native language, but due to various factors, it is currently endangered. I plan to contribute regularly every weekend by adding new translations.

I have followed the guidelines outlined on the Tatoeba Wiki for new language requests. Please let me know if any additional information is required.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
