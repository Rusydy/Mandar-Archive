## 2025-03-01

- I found several links that I can use to learn more about the Mandar language. I added them to the [web links](../../resources/web_links.md) file.
- I also discovered several books about the grammar and vocabulary of the Mandar language. I placed them in the [resources](../../resources/) folder.
- Yesterday, I sent a request to the Tatoeba project team and am still waiting for their response. According to their website, they will reply within two weeks.
- I want to scale up my project. However, I need to properly launch this VitePress website. I need to compare the prices of different domain providers and hosting services. I hope to resolve this issue in the next few days.

- This past week, I have been working on the database design for the dictionary app. I have created a schema for the database and started to write the SQL queries. Here is the link to the [diagram](https://www.drawdb.app/editor?shareId=d1b3348f3393baee714865dff9bb4924).
- I also reached out to the Tatoeba project team and received a [response](https://github.com/Tatoeba/tatoeba2/discussions/3167#discussion-8173436). They will add 'Mandar (ISO 639-3: mdr)' to their language list, but they let me to create a new PR myself to speed up the process.
- I explore a new tool called [Method.ac](https://editor.method.ac/) to create a simple drawing and a [SVG cleaner](https://svgcleaner.com/) to clean up SVG files.
