This is a log of the events in 2025. I will use the YYYY-MM-DD format.

## 2025-03-01

- I found several links that I can use to learn more about the Mandar language. I added them to the [web links](../../resources/web_links.md) file.
- I also discovered several books about the grammar and vocabulary of the Mandar language. I placed them in the [resources](../../resources/) folder.
- Yesterday, I sent a request to the Tatoeba project team and am still waiting for their response. According to their website, they will reply within two weeks.
- I want to scale up my project. However, I need to properly launch this VitePress website. I need to compare the prices of different domain providers and hosting services. I hope to resolve this issue in the next few days.
